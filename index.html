<p> Rhode Island Parrot Rescue houses all sorts of parrots and lorikeets
    that, for whatever reason, could no longer be taken care of by their previous owner. The reasons for this vary.
    Sometimes the birds were never treated right, sometimes they were taken from the wild, and sometimes their owners
    simply could not afford to take care of them. One of the more common issues is the birds outliving their owners, as
    some parrots can have almost human-like lifespans. </p>

    <aside> While some of these birds were adopted already, none of them were adopted by me. These are my favorite birds
        from my time volunteering at this rescue!</aside>
