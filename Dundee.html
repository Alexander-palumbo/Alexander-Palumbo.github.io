<p>Dundee is a very sweet cockatoo. His owner passed away, thus leading to him ending up at the rescue. Like many birds
at the rescue, he has plucked at much of his feathers, although I believe he may have stopped plucking by the time
of the pictures above. He is my favorite as, when he came into the rescue, he was very standoffish and bitey. I was able
to observe him becoming more well-behaved throughout most of my time volunteering. </p>

Dundee has since been adopted.
